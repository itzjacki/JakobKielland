import Email from "@/components/Email.astro";

These are emails from a prank I pulled on my friend. He had bought the domain "ladebil.no" in hopes of selling it for a profit, and as luck would have it, I stumbeled upon a (real) band called La Débil on bandcamp. I then pretended to be Pablo Botón, and contacted my friend saying I wanted to buy it. These are the emails that ensued. His name is censored for privacy, but know that I purposfully misspelled it in every single email.

Thank you for your email.

Lade bil means "Charge your car" in Norwegian. The domain name is not random nor a copy of your band name. However, I am not sure about the laws regarding .no domains and transfers to foreigners.

Mvh, David

Hello señor David.

I am not conserned that you steal our name, we are recenlty grow much and therefore we want to make norwegian website for norwegian developer. We do not look originally for to change transfer of domain to spanish. We would like to keep it in norwegian server and then make it redirect to our bandcamp: https://ladebil.bandcamp.com/

Do you think this is possible also what price would you consider your web domain to be worth?

Hello señor Skalin,

Your webside design skill is very impressive, although audio is a bit disturbing.
I think euro 250 is a bit too much, is almost as much as my salary of a week. How would you like to develop our website for page for Norway? It seems you are very able at webdesing.

Where did you aquire your estimate of price?

Yours truly

Pablo Botón,
community manager La Débil band.
