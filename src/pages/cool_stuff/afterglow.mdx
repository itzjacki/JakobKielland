Afterglow is first and foremost a java project, let me make that very clear. The entire reason I made this was because of an assignment at my university, where we were tasked with creating a game of our choosing.

To practice timed events and animation i decided to make a rhythm game. For the music to go with it, I chose my favorite super-high-energy tune, "Brain Power" by Noma. I did try and contact him about a week before uploading the game here, and he actually responded, albeit a few weeks after the game and trailer was complete. He gave me the right to use the song, as long as it would only be used in a non-commercial context, and would not itself be redistributed. The main reason I wanted to upload the game is obviously to let other people actually try the game, and see how they do. I have also uploaded the source code, so that anyone can take a look at how I wrote it all. Enjoy!
