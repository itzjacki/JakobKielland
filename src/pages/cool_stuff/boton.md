# The tale of Pablo Boton

These are emails from a prank I pulled on my friend. He had bought the domain "ladebil.no" in hopes of selling it for a profit, and as luck would have it, I stumbeled upon a (real) band called La Débil on bandcamp. I then pretended to be Pablo Botón, and contacted my friend saying I wanted to buy it. These are the emails that ensued. His name is censored for privacy, but know that I purposfully misspelled it in every single email.
